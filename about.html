            Hello, my name is Emma Snider. I am a full time design student at Algonquin College. I am in the 2 year Interactive Media Design Program. I started doing technological design back in high school and discovered my aptitude for it. 

            I can use most Adobe softwares, my strongest being Photoshop and Illustrator. Meaning, I am very good at editing photos and creating digital artworks. I have designed logos, banners, buttons; you name it!

            Coding has been one of my strongest subjects since I was 14. I started off coding with Scratch, and now here I am, coding this website! I know HTML, CSS and JavaScript however when it comes to web design I can also use content management systems like Wordpress, Drupal and Shopify. 

            My start to photography was when I was a competitive horseback rider. I got really good at shooting action shots of friends jumping and started going to shows, to photograph and film other riders. I still love animal photography but I also love portraits, landscapes and abstract photography.
