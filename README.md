# My Portfolio 

### add information assuming that you are asked to give a brief description on how you created your web portfolio during an interview. This should include what challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. Talk about what you learned by creating your web portfolio

This is my web portfolio, I designed it this way mostly becasue I hope to grow into it. I am still very early in my career, only 18. I have a long time to build my portfolio and skillset but I wanted a really clean, sharp, attractive and well done portfolio. I can see myself, due to my age, being overlooked in this profession. I don't come accross as proffesinal, but more fun and light hearted. So while I wanted this postfolio to suit my style and livleyhood, I went for a more subdued color palette and mature tone. All of which I think I accoplished.

I always start with mobile styles and work my way up. In my opinion, mobile should be the easierst to view, while web is the easiest to use. Accessibility is something that we as an industry need to strive to do better with. Every single screen size, should have a useable interface and clean appearance. This is something I spent a long time working on. 

I would say that was the most difficult challange, making every screen look good and transitions between media queries seemless. I also struggled a bit with my flex elements and making sure they would show up correctly, when in doubt though I resort to using grids. I used a lot of trial and error throughout this process, mostly fiddling with layouts and technicaly placement parts. 

Building a full scale website from scratch is something I am very proud of, I learned alot about the whole process and the work behind each screen. This project took me nearly 40 hours to complete and I am extremely pleased witht he finished product.
